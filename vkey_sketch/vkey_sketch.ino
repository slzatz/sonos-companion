 VKey Voltage Keypad decoding demo

 This demonstrates interfacing the SparkFun VKey voltage keypad using 
 the VKey Arduino library.
 
 The VKey has an array of 12 pushbuttons, each producing a unique analog 
 voltage when  pushed.  A microcontroller can read the voltage, and determine 
 which key has been pressed.  The VKey library keeps track of the analog pin 
 connection, key status, and voltage calibration details.
 
 The VKey was connected to the Arduino as follows:
 VKey GND  -> Arduino GND
 VKey Vout -> Arduino analog input A1
 VKey V+   -> Arduino VCC 
 
 To use the library, instantiate a VKey object and periodically check for input 
 using the checkKeys() function.

 Resources:
 no additional library requirements

 Development environment specifics:
 Developed on Arduino IDE 1.0.5
 Tested on a 5V Redboard and 3.3V Pro Mini

    /* CheckKeys will always return the current key in parameter k.
       The boolean return value indicates whether that value is different than
       the previous value.

  {
    // Only print when value has changed
    Serial.print("Got key: ");
    Serial.println(k);
  }

  // The responsiveness of the keypad depends on how frequently it is checked. 
  // 50 milliseconds seems to be a reasonable poll interval.
